# Tripurari's dotfile

This will install a very good vim configration and plugins

To setup just copy and paste these command 

```
1. git clone https://github.com/tripurari001/dotfile.git ~/.vim

2. cd ~/.vim && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```
This will install [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for vim. If you are using vim inside terminal
then please install this color scheme for your terminal also otherwise this will not look good in terminal.
