# Tripurari's dotfile

This repository is created for people who want to setup some cool vim configuration and plugins
in few simple step.

To setup just copy and paste these command 

```
1. git clone https://github.com/tripurari001/dotfile.git ~/.vim

2. cd ~/.vim && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```
This will install [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for vim. If you are using vim inside terminal
then please install this color scheme for your terminal also otherwise this will not look good in terminal.

If you **don't** want to use **Solarized color scheme** then remove following from your *$HOME/.vimrc*

```
set background=dark
colorscheme solarized
```
